## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week for 6 weeks, 2 hours / session (test 2/23/22 4:17pm)

## SCUBA: Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus

This course will thoroughly educate the successful student with the knowledge and skills necessary to be a certified beginning SCUBA diver. The prerequisite for the course is passing the MIT SCUBA swim test and demonstrating a "comfort level" in the water. At the end of the class, students will attempt to pass the certification exam to become certified divers.

The class is taught in two parts each week: a classroom session and a pool session. The classroom sessions along with the reading material will provide the student with the knowledge necessary to pass the written exam. At the pool, the water skills are taught in progressions that build on the previous skills, making the difficult skills seem easy.

There are six to seven two hour sessions in the classroom and the same number in the pool, depending on the ability of the class. The weekly schedule can be seen in the {{% resource_link 7afda057-7959-674d-3716-91d14e50326a "calendar" %}} section, and more in-depth lecture topics can be seen in the {{% resource_link e4b32797-c567-364b-f241-7d84b59e16ae "lecture notes" %}} section.

At the end of the class, the participants take a written exam, and participate in dives required for certification. The certification dives occur on the weekend following the conclusion of the course and take place on the north shore of Boston, typically in Nahant or Rockport, MA. These are full day events. One snorkel dive and four SCUBA dives must be completed. Each dive contains progressing skills.

The course fee of $300 covers all rental equipment, class and course materials, air fills, C-card and certification dives. Those preferring to use their own equipment are encouraged to do so, but no equipment beyond a bathing suit is required.

## About the Instructor

Halston Taylor's cross country coaching career began at MIT in 1982 and since that time, the squad has become one of the most successful programs at the Institute. Coach Taylor has led Tech through 10 undefeated seasons and three others marred by one loss. The Engineers are also a perfect seven-for-seven at the NEWMAC Cross Country Championships under his watch.

During Halston's tenure, the cross country team has been ranked as high as fifth nationally. He has been on the receiving end of numerous postseason coaching accolades, including a streak of five-straight Constitution Athletic Conference Coach of the Year awards in the 1990's; replaced by a current run of seven consecutive awards from the NEWMAC citing Taylor's coaching excellence.

In track, Halston begins his 14th season as head coach of the men's track and field team at MIT as one of the premier recruiters and coaches in the nation. With a combined coaching record of 215-21, Taylor has solidified MIT's position as one of the most dominant track and field programs in the region. In 2005, Taylor copped his sixth NEWMAC Coach of the Year citation. He guided the Engineers through an unblemished year in 2003 (15-0 indoors, 8-0 outdoors), leading to two New England Division III Championships. Taylor's teams have also captured six of the last seven NEWMAC Championships.

The indoor and outdoor teams regularly qualify individuals for the NCAA Championships, and under Taylor's guidance, MIT has elicited 122 All-Americans and 12 National champions.

Before arriving at MIT, Taylor coached the women's track club at South Carolina and was the boy's track coach at both Granby and Mohawk Regional high schools in Massachusetts.

A native of Columbia, S.C., Taylor is a graduate of the University of South Carolina where he was a four-year letter winner and a 4:05-miler. After receiving his undergraduate degree in Physical Education, Taylor entered UMass-Amherst to study and receive his Masters in Exercise Science.
